# MoveSim

In order to test out [pg_eventserv](https://github.com/crunchydata/pg_eventserv), I needed a way to generate a lot of simultaneously moving objects that saved their state directly into the database. This does that. Could be generalized a bit with different output targets and actual configuration directives for things like number of objects, etc.
